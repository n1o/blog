This is work in progress, where I continuously migrate, rewrite, simplify the notes I have. During the years I wrote thousands of pages worth of notes, not always concise. Right now I prefer taking notes that are somewhat similar to the Zettelkasten method. Thus keeping them short, easy to follow, covering at most a single subject.</description></item></channel></rss>
