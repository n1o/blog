The main idea is to decompose a tall and wide matrix into a product of two matrices, one tall and thin and one short and wide.
$$ R_{n\times m} = U_{m \times d} \cdot V_{d \times n} $$
If you are a Bayesian, you can express this model as:
$$ R_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(u_i \cdot v_j^T, \sigma) $$ $$ u_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_u, \Sigma_u) $$ $$ v_j \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_v, \Sigma_v) $$</description></item><item><title/><link>http://fullstackdatascience.tech/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://fullstackdatascience.tech/about/</guid><description>About I&amp;rsquo;m Marek Barak, I started my journey into computer science when I was 15 and started to code in C++. Since then more than 15 years has passed, and I managed to get an Master degree in computer science and statistics from the University of Economics in Bratislava. I had to opportunity to do data science consulting, work for multiple startups in their various stages. Right now I am Data Analytics Lead at Filmzie, where I am responsible for anything that relates to data.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://fullstackdatascience.tech/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://fullstackdatascience.tech/contact/</guid><description>Contact Feel free to contact me via email mrk.barak@gmail.comor socials.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://fullstackdatascience.tech/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://fullstackdatascience.tech/projects/</guid><description>Projects Study notes This is my compilation of notes from various subjects. This is work in progress, where I continuously migrate, rewrite, simplify the notes I have. During the years I wrote thousands of pages worth of notes, not always concise. Right now I prefer taking notes that are somewhat similar to the Zettelkasten method. Thus keeping them short, easy to follow, covering at most a single subject.</description></item></channel></rss>
